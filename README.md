## Hello !

My name is Anna Smyk. I am a time series methodologist at [Insee](https://github.com/InseeFr) 🇫🇷. I work with  on Seasonal Adjustment tools and methods, and mainly on the [JDemetra+](https://github.com/jdemetra) software. We provide beginner and advanced training in seasonal adjustment, as well as assistance in setting up a production process of seasonally adjusted series.

### JDemetra+ documentation 📖

I write the new JDemetra+ online [documentation](https://jdemetra-new-documentation.netlify.app/) with [Tanguy Barthelemy](https://github.com/TanguyBarthelemy), [Alain Quartier-La-Tente](https://github.com/AQLT) and [Karsten Webel](https://github.com/webelk-Authors).

### JD+ Blog

You can follow us on our [JD+ Universe blog](https://jdemetra-universe-blog.netlify.app/).
