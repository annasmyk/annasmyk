## Hello !

I am a time series methodologist at [Insee](https://github.com/InseeFr) 🇫🇷. I work on Seasonal Adjustment tools and methods, and mainly on the [JDemetra+](https://github.com/jdemetra) software. I can provide beginner and advanced training in seasonal adjustment, as well as assistance in setting up a production process of seasonally adjusted series.
Full resume [here](https://github.com/annasmyk/annasmyk/blob/main/CV_Anna_Smyk_2023.pdf)
### JDemetra+ documentation 📖

I write the new JDemetra+ online [documentation](https://jdemetra-new-documentation.netlify.app/) with [Tanguy Barthelemy](https://github.com/TanguyBarthelemy), [Karsten Webel](https://github.com/webelk-Authors) among others.
