## Hello !

I am a time series methodologist at [Insee](https://github.com/InseeFr) 🇫🇷. I work on Seasonal Adjustment tools and methods, and mainly on [JDemetra+](https://github.com/jdemetra) software. I can provide beginner and advanced training in seasonal adjustment, as well as assistance in setting up a production process of seasonally adjusted series.
Full resume [here](https://github.com/annasmyk/annasmyk/blob/main/CV_AnnaSmyk_2024.pdf)

I am an active member of two JDemetra+ related organisations: 

- [rjdverse](https://github.com/stace-tsa-shop): R ecosystem giving access to JDemetra+ algorithms
  
- [stace-tsa-shop](https://github.com/stace-tsa-shop): resources for Time Series Analysis (restricted to STACE-TSA members, access on request)

### JDemetra+ documentation 📖

I write the new JDemetra+ online [documentation](https://jdemetra-new-documentation.netlify.app/) with [Tanguy Barthelemy](https://github.com/TanguyBarthelemy) and [Karsten Webel](https://github.com/webelk-Authors) among others.

### JD+ Blog

You can follow us on our [JD+ Universe blog](https://jdemetra-universe-blog.netlify.app/).

### JD Tutorials ▶️

[Tutorials for JDemetra+ software](https://github.com/TanguyBarthelemy/JD_Tutorials) allow to discover JDemetra+, the Graphical User Interface and the dedicated R packages with pages and videos, available on our 🎥 [youtube channel (@TSwithJDemetraandR)](https://www.youtube.com/@TSwithJDemetraandR).
