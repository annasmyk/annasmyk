## Hello !

I am a time series methodologist at [Insee](https://github.com/InseeFr) 🇫🇷. I work on Seasonal Adjustment tools and methods, and mainly on [JDemetra+](https://github.com/jdemetra) software. I can provide beginner and advanced training in seasonal adjustment, as well as assistance in setting up a production process of seasonally adjusted series.
Full resume [here](https://github.com/annasmyk/annasmyk/blob/main/CV_AnnaSmyk_2024.pdf)

I am the host (on behalf of Insee) of the next edition of **Use of R in Official Statistics (uRos), Nov 18-20 2026, Paris**. More info coming soon !

I am an active member of two JDemetra+ related organisations: 

- [rjdverse](https://github.com/rjdverse): R ecosystem giving access to JDemetra+ algorithms
  
- [cosa-tsa-shop](https://github.com/cosa-tsa-shop): resources for Time Series Analysis around Eurostat founded COSA project.

### JDemetra+ documentation 📖

I write the new JDemetra+ online [documentation](https://jdemetra-new-documentation.netlify.app/) with [Tanguy Barthelemy](https://github.com/TanguyBarthelemy) and [Karsten Webel](https://github.com/webelk-Authors) among others.
